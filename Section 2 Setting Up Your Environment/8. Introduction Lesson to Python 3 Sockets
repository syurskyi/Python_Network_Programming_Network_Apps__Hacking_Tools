Python provides two levels of access to network services. You're able to access to socket capabilities in the
underlying operating system and create both clients and servers for connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless
protocols (UDP)

In addition, Python also has libraries the provide access to specific protocols, such as FTP, HTTP and many others

What are Sockets?
Sockets provide the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets can transfer data within a process
, between processes on the same machine or between processes on different server in different geographical location.

Sockets can be used over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, UDP and so on. The socket
library allows you to handle the common transports used as well as a generic interface for handling the remaining
transports.

Domain - The family of protocols that is used as the transport mechanism. These values are constants such as AF_INT,
PF_INET, PF_UNIX, PF_X25, and so on.

Type - The type of communications between the two endpoints, typically SOCK_STREAM (TCP) for connection-oriented
protocols and SOCK_DGRAM (UDP) for connectionless protocols

Protocol - This used to identify a variant of a protocol within a domain and type.

Host - The identifier of a network interface such as a string, which can be a host name, a dotted-quad address (IP address)
, or an IPV6 address in colon notation.

Port - Each server listens for clients calling on one or more ports. A port may be a integer port number, a string 
containing a port number, or the name of a server.

In order to create a socket, you use the socket.socket() function from the socket module, which has the following syntax:

s = socket.socket(socket_family, socket_type, protocol = 0)

socket_family - AF_UNIX or AF_INET, We'll be using AF_INET
socket_type - SOCK_STREAM(TCP) or SOCK_DGRAM(UDP)
protocol - Does not need to be provided and will default to 0

After creating your socket object, you can then use the socket function to create either a client or server application
